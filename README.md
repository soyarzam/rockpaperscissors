# rockpaperscissors

Play a game of rock, paper, scissors against a computer.
Created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Features:
Three buttons that allow the user to choose between rock, paper, or scissors.
Displays moving text to convey who won each match.
Ends the game when either player reaches five wins, and displays a win/loss message.

I learned how to use:
.disable
Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length)
setTimeout(() => {
}, 1000);
.addEventListener('click', () =>)
